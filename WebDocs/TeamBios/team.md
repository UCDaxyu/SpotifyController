Hello! My name is Alex Yu. I am currently an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at UC Davis. I was born and raised in Sacramento. Out of high school, I enlisted with the U.S. Army Reserve and served as a Cargo Specialist. Returning from training, I enrolled in community college where I started pursuing my love for computers and tech. 
I'm currently doing an eletrical engineering internship with the Transportation Management Center (TMC) at Caltrans.
