The above video demonstrates how to use the controller. After a 30 second initialization period, the controller automatically recognizes the device currently playing and displays basic information like the song's name and the artist on the OLED screen. 
The controller then pauses and rewinds to the start of the player to begin. From there the user can use the remote to perform basic control over the spotify player. The following controls are mapped on the remote. 
Visual cues are provided for Play/Pause, Next/Previous, and a Volume Bar is shown discreetly at the bottom.
