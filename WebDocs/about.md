## What is it?
***
This project is a spotify controller implemented entirely using a CC3200 LaunchPad. Using Spotifyâ€™s API, the device can push instructions (such as pause/play, skip track, volume control) to spotify and display metadata of the currently playing track in a user-friendly interface.

We made this project as our final project for our Embedded System Design Class (ECS172) at UC Davis. We were tasked to create a stand-alone, interactive system that controls something over the internet using the REST API and tools we used from previous labs in the class.
