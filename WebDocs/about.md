## What is it?
***

This project is a spotify controller implemented using a CC3200 LaunchPad with peripherals connected to the Amazon Web Service via the internet. Using Spotifyâ€™s API the device can push instructions (such as pause/play, skip track, volume control) to spotify and display metadata of the currently playing track in a user-friendly interface.

To send data from Spotify about what task the user wants done, user input is collected through an IR remote control. Each button of the remote sends a different waveform to the IR receiver connected to our CC3200 LaunchPad. //adding more rn
