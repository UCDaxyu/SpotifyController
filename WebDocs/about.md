### What is it?

This project is a spotify controller implemented using a CC3200 LaunchPad with peripherals connected to the Amazon Web Service via the internet. Using Spotifyâ€™s API the device can push instructions (such as pause/play, skip track, volume control) to spotify and display metadata of the currently playing track in a user-friendly interface.
